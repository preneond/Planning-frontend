The intermodal planner frontend web application has been made as a semestral project. I chose this because I work in the bachelors thesis and since I needed to verify the quality of the planned paths, I used the opportunity to create a frontend in this subject.

The environment is very simple and intuitive. In the left corner there is a user input where the user sets the initial and the target address, chooses what kind of transport he wants to use and search. The input fields can not be broken, so you do not need to write coordinates or otherwise complicate inputs.

You can choose the beginning and end by clicking on the map and then moving it differently. After interacting with the map, the input field is filled in by reverse geocoding, and the user has information about exactly where they clicked.

When you click on the "find" button, the route will be searched for, and you'll find information about travel times and journey times

It works only on the surroundings of PRAGUE !!
